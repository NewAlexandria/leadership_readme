# Anatomy of a CRM System

### On CRM and CX

In my opinion this is one of the harder business-systems patterns to outline via and anatomy. 

* CRMs often focus more on static data with communications-related automation
* CX often focus more on data automations, especially with content and partner services

## Customer experience / Personalization
* Commucations and outreach
* Engagement (datetime, element, location)
* Surveys, active feedback
* Persona / Trait modeling, tagging, schema
* Lifecycles
* Compliance
 
## Sales Ops
* Work queues
* Team metrics, performance
* Permissioning, regionality
* Compensation mertics
* Data quality nudges
* Contextual narrative, scripts, with commenting

## Integrations / Automations
* Synchronization admin (frequency, volumes, exclusions, permissioning)
* Activity data
* Marketplace partners
* Integrators / services
* First-party data admin, segmentation
* Call center
* Project management tooling
* CMS

## Dashboards and Reporting
* Self-service data and queries
* Visualization programming (D3, etc)
* Embeddability
* Work queues
* Lifecycle congestion
* Data quality
* Per-customer journey timelines

## Leads Modeling
* Customizable model fields
* Customizable screens
* Relations between models

## Generic
Common things that are usually provided, but need attention during administration
