# Career Ladder

Recently there has been more reconsideration of what 'levels' look like for a software engineer.  Where there was formerly more homogeneity across development work, there is recently a huge range of specialization. These many areas of specialty challenge the classical idea of seniority, as a very senior-skilled engineer may lack fluency or capability with a pivotal practice that has been nearly mastered by an otherwise-junior developer.  Conversely, junior developers may overestimate their their vision under the study of average teachers. 

In an ideal sense, and one that is humanly-impractical, there could be a method of scoring and totaling one's abilities across all of these pivotal practice areas, and  totaling and aggregate that equates to skill level.  That is a trend toward excessive accounting, or an AD&D-like role-playing schema for one's life.

Today, at least, that is not our culture.  Yet it is good to remember that Amazon and many other large firms have identified a value with interviewing and reviewing using carefully crafted scoring systems.  'Scout badges' may yet return, [if this is a trend](https://www.vegafactor.com).

## Summary skills

Deeply granular assessments are more ideal for differentiating areas of strength, and giving very targeted mentorship and support.  The same can also cause overload.   

A simplified version of skills assessment usually covers these four areas:

* tech quality
* collaboration
* execution
* org quality

Any organization in a company can reuse these by relating 'tech' quality to any use of tools to speed up workflow and delivery.  All code is essentially tools for automation.
