# Ticketing patterns

Write in phases - edit and update.

Live with uncomfortable choice of words/terms, so that it forces all to edit later and get it correct.

Always use a components field for each card.  The components field indicates a specific list of terms that represent the parts. of this application that have business value.  (This is part of what is called the 'Business Ontology')
