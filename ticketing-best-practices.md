# Ticketing patterns

Write in phases - edit and update.

Live with uncomfortable choice of words/terms, so that it forces all to edit later and get it correct.

Always use a components field for each card.  The components field indicates a specific list of terms that represent the parts. of this application that have business value.  (This is part of what is called the 'Business Ontology')

## Types

The following concept of stories, tasks, and bugs helps to define common work in software projects. A team should always talk about limitations or issues that this scheme represents to their type of work.  

Different types are common with Customer Support, IT, HR, Design / Creative, Platform / infrastructure, Data Science, Sales / BD, Reporting, Data Science, Facilities, and others.  Regardless, it is important to be on the watch for the emergence of new Types within a team, or the company at-large. The same goes for the infrequency of a card Type.  These changes can represent the evolution of a business, an industry, or Work.

### Stories
Stories are anything that is a user-facing change or feature. This includes config changes that affects the UX.  

### Tasks
Tasks are any change that is not user-facing. We leave-out changes to performance, and many other semantic arguments.  e.g. a new widget display format may be a Story if it will directly change the format for a user — but a task if it will be part of a library that impacts a user in a subsequent ticket. 

### Bugs
Bugs make a change to anything that is not as originally specified.  This does not include changes that were not specified ideally or correctly during planning.  The purpose of a bug ticket it to notate that there was a regression or incorrect release - but it is not meant to be a penalty to individuals, as often the team collectively owns a relationship to quality. 


## Boards

As you scale, consider that you may benefit from having separate boards for each kind of work happening.  With that, different workflows / columns can help ensure that things are clear to all that work (and on) with the team.  I've seen it increase velocity in perhaps every scenario.
