# Qs

### How many years of experience do you have managing a highly trafficked website? How would you handle a rapid increase?

I've handled truly high-volume sites since 2010, and high data or streaming volumes have been a cornerstone of every business since then. The strategies to prepare for scaling are beyond the scope of this answer box.  Avoid getting into tooling and env costs, often around typesafe languages, and leaning into smart, cache-able, systems designs â€” this is one reliable way to scale up with low cost and be able to plan for the optimal high-volume-business design for the engineering team.  Many (not all) workarounds are fixes based on this template.

### Do you have experience in a Start Up Culture?

Most of my work has been with startups.  Bootstrap to Seed.  Seed to Series A.  A to B.  B to flip.   I also have work with two global enterprises.

### Do you have experience with Ruby on Rails or Rails?

Yes, extensive.  I have worked with Ruby and Rails since ~2006, and consider, myself to be a rubyist.  I've built and released public gems, created unix-idiomatic gems, maintained private gemservers, maintained modifications to rails core, and developed in non-rails ruby environments (vertx.io, grape APIs, etc). Fine grained caching strategies, from where to memoize, up to varnish and ESIs. I'm a recent fan of the Trailblazer pattern. I've developed API products, platform products, and advanced SEO/SEM content publication and marketing tech, using a blend of rails and modern PWA practices. I've leveraged instrumentation patterns using exception handlers and runtime inspection. Probably there are other things to mention, but I felt a stream-of-consciousness would better reinforce the scope in this case.

### How many years of experience do you have with highly trafficked websites?

My first truly high-traffic site was in 2000-2002 (ecomm), but I didn't work on another until 2010.  Most have been high-traffic since then, and several in publishing where ever 10-20ms significantly adds up. I've dealt with large-data-volume businesses since 2000.

### Please tell me your ideal salary for this position.

I can't imagine taking less than $250k base, and with my range of experiences, I think that $275-300k is not an unreasonable base ask.  I have extensive experience owning, introducing, guiding, and measuring, agile whole-company planning, release, and LOB operations. I have routinely advised and audited contracts, and I've developed IP strategies and filed patents. I've nearly lead HR operations, talent recruiting, and internal training. I've been CISO or similar, and initiated and operated the security diligence and practice.  I have a long managing and building infrastructure. I understand ML in depth and have built cognitive products. My training and background in HCI (UX research) focusing on data representation and modeling, and related measures.

### Do you have at least 10 years as a CTO?

With some qualifiers, yes, 10yr experience.  This comes from being the first and primary engineering leader in several startup operations, and being active in driving the strategic dialogue around the needs, operations, and execution of business health.   So my qualifier regards how large of scale of company I've been shouldered with the CTO role.

### How many years of experience do you have as a VP of Engineering?

1 formally as that title, though the past 4 years have served that role, or higher. Having started 4 companies and led a capital raise once, I have as many as 8 yr total experience with practices attention related to the VP of Engineering role.

### Startup experience ?

I've started 4 companies, and led a raised capital.  I've been an advisor to several startups and stable small-businesses in a paid capacity. I've scaled companies from the 10s to the 60s, and past 150.  I've taken a pivotal role in engineering organizations over 200 headcount.
