# Qs

### How many years of experience do you have managing a highly trafficked website? How would you handle a rapid increase?

I've handled truly high-volume sites since 2010, and high data or streaming volumes have been a cornerstone of every business since then. The strategies to prepare for scaling are beyond the scope of this answer box.  Avoid getting into tooling and env costs, often around typesafe languages, and leaning into smart, cache-able, systems designs â€” this is one reliable way to scale up with low cost and be able to plan for the optimal high-volume-business design for the engineering team.  Many (not all) workarounds are fixes based on this template.

### Do you have experience in a Start Up Culture?

Most of my work has been with startups.  Bootstrap to Seed.  Seed to Series A.  A to B.  B to flip.   I also have work with two global enterprises.

### Do you have experience with Ruby on Rails or Rails?

Yes, extensive.  I have worked with Ruby and Rails since ~2006, and consider, myself to be a rubyist.  I've built and released public gems, created unix-idiomatic gems, maintained private gemservers, maintained modifications to rails core, and developed in non-rails ruby environments (vertx.io, grape APIs, etc). Fine grained caching strategies, from where to memoize, up to varnish and ESIs. I'm a recent fan of the Trailblazer pattern. I've developed API products, platform products, and advanced SEO/SEM content publication and marketing tech, using a blend of rails and modern PWA practices. I've leveraged instrumentation patterns using exception handlers and runtime inspection. Probably there are other things to mention, but I felt a stream-of-consciousness would better reinforce the scope in this case.

### How many years of experience do you have with highly trafficked websites?

My first truly high-traffic site was in 2000-2002 (ecomm), but I didn't work on another until 2010.  Most have been high-traffic since then, and several in publishing where ever 10-20ms significantly adds up. I've dealt with large-data-volume businesses since 2000.

### Please tell me your ideal salary for this position.

I can't imagine taking less than $250k base, and with my range of experiences, I think that $275-300k is not an unreasonable base ask.  I have extensive experience owning, introducing, guiding, and measuring, agile whole-company planning, release, and LOB operations. I have routinely advised and audited contracts, and I've developed IP strategies and filed patents. I've nearly lead HR operations, talent recruiting, and internal training. I've been CISO or similar, and initiated and operated the security diligence and practice.  I have a long managing and building infrastructure. I understand ML in depth and have built cognitive products. My training and background in HCI (UX research) focusing on data representation and modeling, and related measures.

### Do you have at least 10 years as a CTO?

With some qualifiers, yes, 10yr experience.  This comes from being the first and primary engineering leader in several startup operations, and being active in driving the strategic dialogue around the needs, operations, and execution of business health.   So my qualifier regards how large of scale of company I've been shouldered with the CTO role.

### How many years of experience do you have as a VP of Engineering?

1 formally as that title, though the past 4 years have served that role, or higher. Having started 4 companies and led a capital raise once, I have as many as 8 yr total experience with practices attention related to the VP of Engineering role.

### Startup Experience?

I've started 4 companies, and led a raised capital.  I've been an advisor to several startups and stable small-businesses in a paid capacity. I've scaled companies from the 10s to the 60s, and past 150.  I've taken a pivotal role in engineering organizations over 200 headcount.



## Domain Knowledge:

### Any examples of consumer facing mobile/web applications (ideally in the fintech space) that youâ€™ve built that you are most proud of? 

ðŸ“™ [Many of these are outlined in my StackOverflow timeline](https://stackoverflow.com/story/newalexandria)

#### Consumer Financial Products
MyBankTracker and Investopedia are both publishers in the space of consumer financial products.  With each of these I built and lead the creation of a high performance / high traffic content assembly system that had top SEO and SEM characteristics.  

In both cases, as well as Even, I designed and led the creation of a widget system for financial Product display.  Display formats included free tables, calculators, questionnaires, recommenders full page content highlight cards, and a range of IAB formats.   All of these were designed to work with a personalization engine that drew data from our content pages, as well as from data metrics pulled from across the range of our partner network.  

All of these systems redefine the way that we did our business intelligence process, on account of being able to perform more targeted multivariate optimization on both sides of our two-sided marketplace.   I was a strong ally to business planning and modeling teams, on the counter by extensive experience with business ontologies, and related industrial data standards and steering committees.

#### Loans

I led several impactful changes to a loan origination system (reverse syndication). This included data warehousing and big data engineering (reporting times from 16-28hrs, to 30-70minutes);  a remarketing and reengagement messaging framework that worked with application state and regulatory compliance;  and back office operational tooling that doubled our throughput.  
 

### Can you speak to any key metrics to measure their success?

Many were embedded above. The SEO and SEM measures enabled us to push many of our pages into the first 1-2 pages of search results.  I learned more elaborate strategies for this at Investopedia.  

With their personalization and recommendation systems, the key metrics were sizes of clusters/segmentations, and the ability to more-strategically price them. Also we were able to develop programs and offerings for smaller audiences than would have been prior efficient.   

### Do you have experience building customer-facing applications where fast iteration and growth needs to be balanced with precision and regulation?

Most of the above systems had that constraint.  Individual pages or widgets would be redeveloped with new tech that provided better data. Deployment would enable production â€˜isolationâ€™ and reliability. New data dashboard pages would be beta tested before migration.  External tools would be leveraged before building and supporting something in house. 

New product / features would be chartered and agile-planned at the business level before leaping to an engineering build.  This created lean loops that minimized Engineering time until relevant. 


### Overall, What projects or initiatives are you most proud of spearheading or leading?

The personalization (p13n) engine. The way that p13n was used for SEM, as well as network data management & modeling.

Another one was a â€˜market business cloudâ€™, which I developed and evolved at Bloomberg, and Medidata, and Even.  This is a PaaS product that enabled partners to write and deploy code (apps, and analysics) into our N-sided marketplace.  In each company, this lead to IP-development discussions with the C-suite and patent counsel.
