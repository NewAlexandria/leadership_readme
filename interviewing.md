# Tenets

Above all, 

1. Hire for motivation.
2. Hire those motivated by others’ motivation. (Do not hire anyone that will get in the way of others’ good work.)


## Cultural Values

1. **Don’t have a work allergy**

  > We’re in this because building things is awesome. Sometimes it’s building skyscrapers, and sometimes its digging ditches. 
  
  > a.k.a. _Bias Toward Action_
  
  > Don’t implement the bleeding edge unless it provides business value that nothing else can. Don’t over-engineer for a dirt-shoveling task that takes 30 minutes, 5 times per year. 

2. **Our method is science, Our aim is religion**

  > Not that kind of religion. SEO as a religion.  Webperf as a religion.  Code quality as a religion.
  
  > This is _Consensify_ made into a science.

3. **Everything sucks, don’t be pessimistic**

  > The Good Egg principle.  Good judgment and analysis can only make things better, but griping without a solution just makes for distracting drama.

4. **Lifelong Learning**

  > This is, and always will be, a collegial environment. Tech will never stop mutating. Keep learning. 

1. **Foxhole**

  > Choose to work with people who you would trust to have your back. (literally, as the metaphor goes) Remember what it takes to succeed as a team, not just as a person.

1. **Done Done**

  > Work toward the spirit of things, not the letter.  'CYA' is just a lesser form of failure. Remember to be a Good Egg.

## Career Paths

I still sit with the largely-typical career ladder.  Management and executive titles go with people and leadership skills.  Principle, Architect, and similar titles remain in the code — specifically: *measuring* and *teaching*.  SREs are in both main branches. 

I still see lots of architect roles being performed like a (TPM) technical project manager.  Doing so skews expectations and the market.  It's not a 'tinker neat things' position.

Also, I like to highlight where engineering intersects other departments and teams.  

* Data science.
* Data warehousing and BI.
* Security.
* Risk, compliance, QA automation.
* Sales and solutions architecture.
* Product and Program ownership. 

These are often overlooked areas, and are viable career paths if a person doesn’t squarely align to Engineering.
