# Tenets

Above all, 

1. Hire for motivation.
2. Hire those motivated by others’ motivation. (Do not hire anyone that will get in the way of others’ good work.)

## Cultural Values

1. **Don’t have a work allergy**
    1. We’re in this because building things is awesome. Sometimes it’s building skyscrapers, and sometimes its digging ditches. 
    2. Don’t implement the bleeding edge unless it provides business value that nothing else can. Don’t over-engineer for a dirt-shoveling task that take 30 minutes 5 times per year. 
2. **Our method is science, Our aim is religion**
    1. Not that kind of religion. SEO as a religion.  Webperf as a religion.  Code quality as a religion.
3. **Everything sucks, don’t be pessimistic**
    1. Good judgment and analysis can only make things better, but griping without a solution just makes for distracting drama.
4. **Lifelong Learning**
    1. This is, and always will be, a collegial environment. Tech will never stop mutating. Keep learning. 


> Be Brave, Be Smart, and Give a Shit.
