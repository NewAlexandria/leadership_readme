# Wiki Patterns	

### Finding the Home


### Make templates

If many of the same pages will be made, make a template.  Templates usually capture best-practices around a topic, so it's good to get people to relate with those structures. 

### Edit the Page, don't Comment

Free free (anytime / future) to make direct additions to the page.  I know there can be a tendency to think that someone else is the author or maintainer of a doc – and it feels polite to not change someone else’s work.  What scales best, though, is when we all edit docs directly, and develop house-rules in the few occasions that an issue occurs.

### Follow the main pages for your teams

The wiki will typically have sections for the whole company, each 'department', and each team. You can Watch, or subscribe, to these pages and get notified when they are edited.  Far from being noise, these updates are often significant, and link you to new 'top level' things related to your group. 

### Create Email Rules for Notifications

Avoid notification overload - use folders.  Create an "Updates" folder and create a child within it, "Wiki" or "Team Docs".  When you get email notifications about wiki updates, right-click the email and setup a new rule to organize them into that folder.  You may need help from someone that does IT support.
