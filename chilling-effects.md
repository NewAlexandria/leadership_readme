# Chilling Effects

In consideration of the idea that come things can taint a company's culture, I wanted to experiment with building a list.  In theory, this list would not get outdated, except maybe over very long periods of time. 

I admit that what is 'chilling' to one demographic may not be to another, and we may get some semantics here.

* corporate values posters
* corporate values posters in the bathroom
* feeling like one is being abused for the bottom line
* good HR
* “Let’s circle back” punctuating every sentence
* Forced expectation of clapping with slides and similar. 'Clap culture'
