# Chilling Effects

In consideration of the idea that come things can taint a company's culture, I wanted to experiment with building a list.  In theory, this list would not get outdated, except maybe over very long periods of time. 

I admit that what is 'chilling' to one demographic may not be to another, and we may get some semantics here.

* corporate values posters
* corporate values posters in the bathroom
* feeling like one is being abused for the bottom line
* 'good HR' as strongly independent of teams and practice groups in the force-norming of culture.;
* “Let’s circle back” regularly punctuating sentences
* Forced expectation of clapping with slides and similar. 'Clap culture'

[HBR proposed a summary](https://archive.is/NmwZD) of the silent dysfunctions that these chilling effects emerge from

* To avoid conflict and gain approval
* To replace genuine inclusion
* To show exaggerated deference to the chain of command
* To motivate people instead of holding them accountable

which can embed overt dysfunctions

* delayed Crisis activation
* Choked innovation
* Bleeding talent
* Low-velocity decision making
* Learned helplessness

along with remedies / a rubric

* Clarify expectations, standards of performance, and meeting types
* Publicly challenge the status quo you helped create
* Provide air cover for candor
* Confront performance problems immediately
