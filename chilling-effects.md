# Chilling Effects

In consideration of the idea that come things can taint a company's culture, I wanted to experiment with building a list.  In theory, this list would not get outdated, except maybe over very long periods of time. 

I admit that what is 'chilling' to one demographic may not be to another, and we may get some semantics here.
