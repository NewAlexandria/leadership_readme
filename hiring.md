# Measures for Hiring tactics

Some would argue that the core of how to measure hiring efforts include:

* Engagement 
* Time to hire 
* retention rate
* Cost per hire
* Team output; MoM
* Team output; YoY

These can be thought of as KPIs, or, the metrics behind any OKRs that are framed.

### Out of bounds

If the team runs itself for 6 months while you struggle to source/hire, then you can probably promote instead.

## Recruiters

Anyone doing recruiting, internal and external, have a sales-oriented role.  It's critical that they understand this, feel armed to do so, and coordinate their piece of the 'pitch' (branding).

* For external recruiters, think of an office tour. If you don’t have an office, then set up a videoconference meeting and let them meet the team and ask questions. Invite to happy hour.
* Spend at least an hour going over the mission, the company and what you are looking for.  Have them give their pitch back to you to make sure they know the ins and outs.
* Make sure people doing recruiting have the mobile number of a key hiring manager.  It's teamwork end-to-end, and it contributes to the sense of the company that is conveyed.
* Continue to build this aspect of the company's relationship over time.  Don’t assume the job is done because you started off right. Relationships are not a transaction.


## Errata

* sourcing criteria
* matchers per-team per-role
* ATS integration
* screener call, HR
* screener call, team
* code challenge equivalent
* onsite interview dimensions 
* rubric iteration
