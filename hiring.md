# Measures for Hiring tactics

Some would argue that the core of how to measure hiring efforts include:

* Engagement 
* Time to hire 
* retention rate
* Cost per hire
* Team output; MoM
* Team output; YoY

These can be thought of as KPIs, or, the metrics behind any OKRs that are framed.

## Errata

* sourcing criteria
* matchers per-team per-role
* ATS integration
* screener call, HR
* screener call, team
* code challenge equivalent
* onsite interview dimensions 
* rubric iteration
