# Information Security

## Top-level Practices

* policy maintenance and alignment
* hardware operation
* practices training
* configuration and access controls
* audits fulfillment
* vendor audits
* ongoing monitoring
* incident management
* site(s) security

### Issues:

1. Burden of practicing
1. Burden of regularity
1. Personal practice consistency
1. Facilities practice coordination
1. Partner/Vendor audit relations
1. Executive approval and Delivery
1. Cross-team planning and ownership

## Practice Guidance

### Policy maintenance and alignment

* Review existing policy docs to confirm accuracy.
  * Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery policies (BC / DR)
* Yearly review and sign-off

### hardware operation

* Setup of newly-bought hardware in a timely manner
* Reformatting of transferred hardware (upgrade, departure, repairs)

### practices training

* HR needs to be the recipient of most training confirmations, for legal reasons.  EY and similar auditors demand historic validation of this.
* DR recovery exercises, records, and evidence
* BC exercises
* Incident response exercises

### configuration and access controls

* AWS best practices by industry-standard
* changes within timesframe committed by contract
* setup and disabling of account access (any tool) in a ticketed manner
* access changes by request, also ticketed. (e.g. eng-support)

### audits fulfillment

* Developing and Maintaining practices mappings.
* Ability to speak to specifics and justifications, in an audit.  Our partners keep detailed records of everything we discuss with them, the timing, and our stated rationale. 
* Keep well-organized files in the Drive.  Don't store things in email, where they can be lost.  Not saving-to-drive should be an exception.
* Make copies of files / folders sent to partners in an audit.  As we change our practices, we would be linking to files that are not what they partner saw. 

### vendor audits

* A multi-faceted process that involves more than just engineering. 
* Staged, and sets of questions incorporated organically into bizdev and other client relations, in an ongoing fashion.
* Types / definitions, or properties / labels
* When to have practice symmetry vs. not.

### ongoing monitoring

* cross-team metrics
* per-team metrics
* key systems
* edges (networks, machines, etc)
* acceptable ranges, and health definition bands
* logs + exception summarization (secondary reporting)

### incident management

* runbooks
* trigger definitions (via monitoring)
* comms templates
* comms scope
* personnel chains
* training
* exercises

### Site security

* visitor registration
* CCTV
* door/window security
* street-level access
* manual confirmation
* elevator controls
* chaperoning
* badge control
