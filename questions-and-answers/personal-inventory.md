# Communications Styles

Learning savvy communications is an important part of any professional and personal growth.  Many systems exist to try to fingerprint a person's thinking and comms style.  They will never completely depict someone, and additionally, we continue to grow and explore the social space of communication.

The follow outline comes from a 'communications inventory' that loosely bases itself on the [Meyer's Briggs system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myersâ€“Briggs_Type_Indicator).  The Crystal company has devised this one, and [you can jump into it here](https://crys.io/s/FwN044).

While far from, this inventory has many similarities to what I have already learned about myself.  A decent conversation starter.
