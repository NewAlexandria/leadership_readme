# Judgment Call

I had a tough decision to make recently. 

### the business issue

The context was our business growth, and the targets that were needed.  We were a Series A company and were targeting our B round. More than $60MM valuation at Series A, we needed to raise $200-250MM in our B round.  The milestones to get there were something of a moving target, but a common hunch was that we would do well if we secured a new major partner that was tied to diversifying to deliver another major line-of-business (LOB).  Getting there would require strong coordination from everyone, to plan, sell, and build, while executing on the growth of existing business.

### the situation

For this new LOB, a SaaS offering was one of the main concepts in development.  Several other ideas were tested, but were not getting as much traction as fast, regardless of how to execute. We determined that we could offer a new product that used our existing infrastructure and services, with the help of a new webapp that offered admin and portal features based on a range of users roles.

### intractable analysis

To get the SaaS offering right would require clear planning, specification, and execution speed.  While these are normal operational values, the tolerances for wobble were low because of the slow client-dependent cycles, and the need to ultimately deliver faster than the opportunity cost of their internal development.  Doing so would represent a major challenge in our startup environment.  Teams that would plan and design the offerings and product were recently hired, and did not have developed-relationships of working together.  OKRs showed our recent cadence was not working hard to maintain current operations.  A complex new project would introduce new forms of risk in addition to heightening existing risk.   The root of the matter needed to be solved in order to successfully deliver on any plan that would materialize a new LOB capable of solidifying our next venture round.

### A decision making process

A break-down of the specific patterns occurring arouse disagreement about the source and solution to each.
