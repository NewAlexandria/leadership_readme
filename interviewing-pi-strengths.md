# Strengths Assessment

The Predictive Index system, in one test, analyzes how we see ourselves, and what we think others expect of us.  It is a useful and powerful reflection.

If you don't want to take a PI test now, look at this table and ask yourself

* which of these do i think is a strength of mine?
* which of these are expected of me in my role?
