# Team Files and Shares

### Google Team Drives

Team Drive access permissions are at the drive level.  That means taht you typucaly get two kinds of shares:

1. Edit access for the whole team, all others Comment only
2. Company share, with Edit access for all.
3. Private team share, with limited access (usually legal stuff)


Best Practice for the highest valuation of a future audit

 (besides me), you can remove my access and then safely add all of your files there, without exposing any of them to me.  File access is done in one place, so you have confidence that no one will accidentally expose files. 

See the attached file.

This works great for teams that need better control over files, like HR and the exec team.  For other team, most of their files can be open to the whole company, with limitations on to only comment or view.  Sales may be an exception to this, but ideally legal stuff like raw revenue, and contracts stuff, stays within the exec team, and all other client info remains open.

If you want to make HR-related files available to those that cannot see your HR team drive, then we can come up with a consistent convention for all of the teams.  Perhaps an all-company team share.

The important thing is that we use the team drives for important core files.  Without that, we may lose all files created by anyone that leaves the company.  It cause another layer of risk, with leadership attrition.  Ideally this company is a jackpot, and we all retire from here, but (I argue) we need to lean toward policy for certain operational matters like this.   This is all an effort to get us as close as possible to enterprise-grade systems, without the overhead of them at enterprise scale.
