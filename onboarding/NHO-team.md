## Remote Onboarding of Jr. Developers

These are common ideas to [[_site/remote-work|Distributed / Remote Work]] but they work especially well for early-career people. 

In all cases it's more about finding the right tone to get people to try it and realize the value.  It can help to screen for willingness and receptivity during onboarding.  Find how to get people to take risks and experiment with the changing office landscape, but know the chemistry of your team, too.

> In the first week, do NOT leave them to their own devices, and do NOT assign them career training materials

It's not everyone's jam, but 'avatar tools' [like Gather.town](https://www.gather.town/) help to create some of the spatial feel of being around others.

You can also do "Shared space" sessions, where everyone joins a video call while doing quiet solo work.  People can split off if a question gets too distracting to others.  Sometimes these are best done in pairs, since the conversation styles can be aligned.  

Regular collaborative sessions, such as mandatory pair and mob programming, are also effective.

#### Journaling and Relative Time

You can also look to promote Journaling vs Standup.  This is more common to when time zones and scheduled don't overlap enough.  But, with a jr or new hire, there are many things they'll be thinking, and their effective 'time and space' will be very different from the rest of the team.  Even if they are in the same office.  Look to use intermittent daily journaling to give value in place of common standup time, and to act a bit like a GTD / pomodoro.



### Mentorship

You are asking the rest of your team members to add "mentorship" to their weekly work, and duties.  Communicate expectations, requirements, and policies, and ensure conversation to find the balances, and out-of-balances.

Here are some [common guidelines](https://dev.to/codemouse92/training-juniors-remotely-is-possible-heres-how-1g0n):

- Ask more questions than you give answers. Try to lead the mentee to discover the answer themselves.
- Demonstrate more than explain.
- Be honest with your shortcomings.  Normalize making, owning, and fixing mistakes.
- Offer to research with the mentee, even if you know the answer. No one is born knowing how to properly use Google, ChatGPT, or Stack Overflow.
- When you explain something, always have the mentee explain it back to you.
- Let the mentee devise their own solutions.
- Show when to make documentation


#### Asks plenty of open-ended questions.

In particular, I recommend the following:

- What went well this week?    
- What challenges did you face?
- What have you learned this week?
- What are you trying to solve right now?
- How can I/we best support you this coming week?

## Things To Watch Out For

* Lack of attention to detail
* Poor time and priority management
* Isolation, or "Lone-Wolfing" (and Psychological Safety)
