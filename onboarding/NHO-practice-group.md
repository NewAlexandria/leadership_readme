### Engineering tech debt types

These are a [proposed list](https://technology.riotgames.com/news/taxonomy-tech-debt) of tech debt types.

* Local Debt
* MacGyver Debt
* Foundational Debt
* Data Debt

While these follow a humanistic heuristic, [Fowler's quadtrant](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html) is worth considering:

|      ðŸŽ­      	| Reckless                       	| Deliberate                                     	|
|-------------	|--------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------	|
| Prudent     	| "We don't have time for design 	| We have to ship now regardless of consequences 	|
| Inadvertant 	| What's Layering?               	| We now know how we should have done it.        	|

### Analyzing a codebase

* Is there a dependency analyzer in-use already? If not:
  * What languages and libraries/frameworks are used?
  * What are some commonly used external dependencies?
* What is the file structure?
* Youâ€™ve picked a file or a module â€“ what does this file or module do and how does it do it?
* Identify coding style patterns.
* Whatâ€™s your overall impression of the code quality?
  * Are there localized differences?  Several?
* Fix bugs
* Write tests
