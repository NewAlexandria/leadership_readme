## Leadership board

Having a leadership board is as important as a team's scrum board, Product's 'idea board', ops post-mortems, or the list/notes from retrospective.  


* new ideas box/column
* things to vett box/column.
 * usually have some priority / imperative quality.
 * often these are ideas with a clear need
* only one things in motion at a time.
 * management changes can disrupt things.  
 * Let people see, think, learn.  Let things gel.  
 * Measure one thing at a time. 

### An Initiative

These can follow the "PRFAQ" format, of pitching the change and 'new world', followed by Q&A items.  Some good items to address:

* why
* what
* how
* cost
* outcome

When there are strongly differing opinions on Why or How, it may be appropriate to plan and vett both/all approaches.

### Outcomes and Cost

* target impact, 
* how we will measure impact, 
* resources needed to execute, and 
* risks, when present

## Review Meetings

There are a few foci for the group-think around leadership initiatives.  They can happen as the agenda for one regular meeting, or any other break-out that works for everyone. (it's just a decision of team culture & psychology)

* Open Review of vet-able ideas (consensus, support)
* Prioritization Review (is it really ready)
* In progress Review
* Post Mortem Review
