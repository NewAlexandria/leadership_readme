# Coaching and Training


## The PIP

I generally avoid hosting a PIP, unless HR mandates it.  

I've had to handle situations where someone was in this place.  I've helped a person recover, and I've had to let people go.  I've had to own it when people I report to would not.  I've been a fairly often an ally of HR, since I care about people, team, and orgs, and see dynamics in-formation.

With PIPs, most people change their behavior for the worse, when they're handed a PIP during the 1:1 cycle.  The younger end of people, today, will respond better to constructed learning, feedback, and targeted growth (with returns). I think it's a result of a shift toward ambiguous training and lacking mentorship from schools and parents/community.  

PIPs often read as leadership failed to give direction and coaching to an employee about growth targets â€” or hired them wrongly. It breeds resentment. The 1:1 cycle should be personable while discussing needed targets, and why, and listening to their POV.  

### Timelines

I generally soft-PIP for 3 months or so, as I see the issue emerging.  Usually that nips it in the bud.  Sometimes it takes longer and I get more repetitive and focal in the latter part, or over a total of max-6 months.  At worst, usually someone will find a new job before they need to be fired.  Once, we planned the separation openly and supportively. 

In all cases, respect is maintained, brand reputation, and we all have the advance perspective on whatever is coming.
