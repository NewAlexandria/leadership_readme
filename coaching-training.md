# Coaching and Training

## Scaling Teams

At small companies the main pain is hiring experienced-enough people that ‘jr’ devs can be hired later, and join a strong set of workflows and relationships.  

With larger teams and mature companies, the pains are usually onboarding knowledge-transfer (‘all the things’) and balancing who does specialization vs generalist eng. problem solving.  With distributed teams,  all meetings and checking’s need to be slightly more regular more consistent than entirely local offices,  as well as the instigation of shared cultural experiences among the team.

The choice to code-eval during interview is another major cultural pattern.  Consistent interviews, trusting fairness, and strengthening viewpoint diversity also need to be solved.

All of these things cannot be wholly owned by engineering leadership unless  something major is omitted, like more hands-on architectural involvement, or process workflow and coordination, either within engineering or cross-company.  

## The PIP

I generally avoid hosting a PIP, unless HR mandates it.  

I've had to handle situations where someone was in this place.  I've helped a person recover, and I've had to let people go.  I've had to own it when people I report to would not.  I've been a fairly often an ally of HR, since I care about people, team, and orgs, and see dynamics in-formation.

With PIPs, most people change their behavior for the worse, when they're handed a PIP during the 1:1 cycle.  The younger end of people, today, will respond better to constructed learning, feedback, and targeted growth (with returns). I think it's a result of a shift toward ambiguous training and lacking mentorship from schools and parents/community.  

PIPs often read as leadership failed to give direction and coaching to an employee about growth targets — or hired them wrongly. It breeds resentment. The 1:1 cycle should be personable while discussing needed targets, and why, and listening to their POV.  

### Timelines

I generally soft-PIP for 3 months or so, as I see the issue emerging.  Usually that nips it in the bud.  Sometimes it takes longer and I get more repetitive and focal in the latter part, or over a total of max-6 months.  At worst, usually someone will find a new job before they need to be fired.  Once, we planned the separation openly and supportively. 

In all cases, respect is maintained, brand reputation, and we all have the advance perspective on whatever is coming.
