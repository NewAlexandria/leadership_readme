# BC & DR Policy Concepts


With business continuity, disaster recovery, and related optics, there are a number of concepts and practice-docs that can 'matrix' into corporate and operational competencies.  It’s worth understanding these, to give a sense of where Even will need to track toward, as it becomes a company of sufficient scale of partner value and operations. 

While the points on can be staged out in several ways, the early-stage options below are the first we would think about.

> A BC DR audit is different in scope and context than a SOC II.

> Especially: no version of a SOC II is considered to be encompassing of a BC/DR review and preparation.

## 📚 Document Types

* Standards
* Policies
* Operating Frameworks
* Playbooks
* RACI
* Testing

*Generally these will document how to practice Governance, Capabilities, and Tools.*


## 👩‍🔬 Scope Areas 👨‍🔬

* Business Continuity
* Disaster Recovery
* Event / Crisis Management
* InfoSec & Physical Security
* Data Controls

*Generally these will define the range and semantics of Governance, Capabilities, and Tools.*

Note that in a SOC II, 70% or so will focus on InfoSec, data, and Recovery, just as we’ve already practiced.  


## Early-Stage options of BC/DR Audit

> Some firms that can do the audit will be highly exposed to our cohort and partners, and can provide guidance that improves our competitiveness.  

> This is one of the major reasons to pay a premium for such companies.
