# Security for Accounts

## When to Create a Domain Account

Often, setting up SaaS accounts for team access, or a master admin credential, requires a related email. We avoid using personal email for these situations.

We should also avoid asking for a new email account to be setup for these purposes.


Problem: gmail accounts are 'domain accounts' that have access to cloud, docs, and other SSO account auto-creation.  Now can be effectively logged into many accounts.
Instructions

* Avoid creating domain users for non-people, unless for hard-technical limits.
* Restricted access groups are preferred.
* Make a domain-group that cannot access common resources: drives, cals, SSO to apps, etc.
* Configure it to receive email from "the whole web".  (this wording may change over time)
* Add any other team members to the group.  Add you boss and anyone else as admins.


## Parties outside of the Domain

As is the case with groups (emails) that can receive info outside the domain, sometimes folders and chats need to be coordinated as well.

### ðŸ—„ File Exchanges (Non-PII)

This is a folder in a personal drive. You cannot do this with Team Drives. Itâ€™s a way to 'swap' files through the account of someone (on the team that needs this), and get those files into whatever is the preferred team space.

### ðŸ’¬ Chat

Similarly, Hangouts and most chat systems can be open-invite.

## Contractors and non-staff employees

Be sure to keep track of similarities and differences between the setup of contractors, as compared with normal employees.

* A G-suite/domain-account account should be confirmed before creating.  Remember that this gives them access to the wiki.
* If they should not have access to the wiki, create a ticket for a 'tools admin' (e.g. Atlassian admin) to restrict what they can see.
* Only add to domain shares (drives, Groups, etc) that have been specified by the person working with the contractor
* Confirm if they know they will handle PII
  * Send them the wiki info / training on Keybase (a content encryption tool).
  * Discuss with the Head of Compliance
* If issuing a laptop
  * Setup the laptop in every normal way.  No exceptions
  * Add their information to the inventory management and disk encryption databases, as normal.
  * Remind those involved that this is a contractor machine
* Convey expected duration of contractor engagement to all parties involved in setup/onboarding.
* Confirm they have signed NDAs, seen policies
* Confirm with hiring-manager which vendors/vendor-software they are expected to use
  * Notify Security or Compliance lead
