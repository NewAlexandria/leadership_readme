# How to Conference

I'm sure that this is going to expand heavily, along with differentiating the kinds of conferences.

### Understand the conference structure

There are less 'types' of conferences, as there are different subsections, which can be in greater or lesser degrees of presence.

* speaker tracks / design
* vendor segments
* breakouts and discussions
* networking areas
* digital media channels
* site services

## Networking

### Be Strategic About The Events You Attend

As you get a handle on the kinds of things you will benefit from, contact staff ahead of the event to determine the size and prevalence of that part of the event.  Sometimes staff's projections can be meaningful. Sometimes the final bookings happen late, so experience can be the best guides

### Take One Action

### Be a presenter

### Pre-plan your time onsite

This includes find role models who are doing great work.

### Setup onsite relationships in advance

### Be open to conversational discovery

### Re-teach what you learned

### Followups

### Engage Your Senses

### Active social media

### Mentoring and Accountability 

### Lay of the Land

Ask onsite staff for confirmation of directions, timing, or anything else.  Learn implicitly how the event has been wired, and where there is the least and the most support.  Know how to find things and act on hints.
