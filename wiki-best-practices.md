# Wiki Patterns	

* If you can edit a word doc, uou can edit a wiki page. all the formatting is the same. 
* Wikis give you new formatting to create blocks of content, and show links to other wiki pages (docs) automatically.
* Use a wiki page when the info will be long lived.
* When the information needs to be findable within context to related info (eg for uour department or team).
  * disk or cloud docs have no inherent navigation, like breadcrumbs, and so are often hard to keep track of.

### Finding the Home

There is an overall company home, which you should have received an email about when you joined. Keep it handy, as it is generally the root of all other information in the wiki. 

### Pages for your department, and team

Just like the company having a home, your team in your department will have a single page that is the basis of all related information. It will also include links to important tools, practices, and related resources.  

If you notice anything that is important to your work, but it’s not mentioned there, you should feel free to add it to the page anytime. You can confirm where it goes, but proactively adding it trumps losing track of an important thought. 

### Make templates

If many of the same pages will be made, make a template.  Templates usually capture best-practices around a topic, so it’s good to get people to relate with those structures. 

### When to edit the Page, When to Comment

Free free (anytime / future) to make direct additions to the page.  I know there can be a tendency to think that someone else is the author or maintainer of a doc – and it feels polite to not change someone else’s work.  What scales best, though, is when we all edit docs directly, and develop house-rules in the few occasions that an issue occurs.

### Follow the main pages for your teams

The wiki will typically have sections for the whole company, each 'department', and each team. You can Watch, or subscribe, to these pages and get notified when they are edited.  Far from being noise, these updates are often significant, and link you to new 'top level' things related to your group. 

### Create Email Rules for Notifications

Avoid notification overload - use folders.  Create an "Updates" folder and create a child within it, "Wiki" or "Team Docs".  When you get email notifications about wiki updates, right-click the email and setup a new rule to organize them into that folder.  You may need help from someone that does IT support.
