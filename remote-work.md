# Remote Work

While the heading of this section is remote work, the reality is that it pertains to all work.  The modern workplace operates remotely for all people.  Most businesses operate with support teams and individuals, whether they are full-time or part-time.  This _distributed team_ environment requires social and technical evolution. 

* teams are inherent distributed. No one should hold the pronoun 'remote', as this makes them a second-class citizen in the company culture. This leads to them be left out of discussions, decisions, and other parts of the business. 
* The most effective forms of influence 
  * rationale
  * inspirational appeals
  * consultation
  * collaboration


## Meetings

* Don't just talk about ideas.  Talk about specific actions, and who will act.
* Agree on both an action, and a target delivery date.  Or, groom the card for story-point estimation

### Accountability

* Avoid talking about an idea, and not confirming actions to be taken by specific people.
* Do not agree upon an action, while omitting a delivery date. (or even a touch-point for review)

### Conversation Types

### Influencing
There exists a proposed scale of influencing, within civil and professional environments:

#### Most Effective

* Rational Persuasion
* Inspirational Appeals
* Consultation
* Collaboration

#### Moderately Effective

* Apprising
* Ingratiating
* Personal Appeals
* Exchange

#### Least Effective

* Legitimating
* Coalition
* Pressure

*Collaboration* can often be thought of as the most sustainable, trainable, and practicable form of influence for maintaining organizational alignment. 

### Multitasking

Multitasking emerges naturally with optimization, and growth of the company.  While it is not ideal, there are a few key mechanisms to understand, talk about, and have clear for all.

> ðŸ’¡ The tl;dr here is that if many people are not paying attention in a meeting, make the meeting more concise, change its membership, and consider canceling it in favor async status updates.

#### Note taking
Laptops and other devices are a natural part of taking notes, for many people.  The use for notes needs to be reinforced.  People still need to avoid 'banging' on keyboards, and disrupting the flow of presentation and conversation.

Mobile phone use is not exception. Your inattention bring-down the mindset of the meeting.

#### Brief and Focused
Meetings can sometimes ramble, or exercise one person's ability to communicate comfortably at the level of the topic. If the meeting will routinely involve this element of personal support, aim for a smaller audience that can reduce the pressure of public speaking, and also provide feedback intermittently. 

It's also a common dilemma that meetings involve an entire agile team, when the topics of the meeting only involve the judgement of few people.  All of the team should feel comfortable with a limited audience attending the meeting.  Consider dial-in for the rest of the team, or the others can rely on meeting minutes to review the highlights of the discussion. 

#### Auditing
An echo to the last point, often people will want to be aware of what's happening in the meeting, and perhaps inject one or two key insights at the right time.  Consider dial-in, even with your headphones from one's desk in the office.

If in-person attendance of meeting 'auditors' seems important, try to follow these two UX principles:

* Do not type loudly on other work, which disrupts everyone with the awareness you are not paying attention.  Even if this means you must type slower, that is the cost of the courtesy, and support of the team.
* Sit at the edges of the room.  Avoid taking a central seat, which will implicitly make you a central member of the meeting.  Aim to be a fly on the wall.

#### Participation
#### Have a role; assignment
#### Agenda
#### Retro
