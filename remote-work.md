# Remote Work

While the heading of this section is remote work, the reality is that it pertains to all work.  The modern workplace operates remotely for all people.  Most businesses operate with support teams and individuals, whether they are full-time or part-time.  This _distributed team_ environment requires social and technical evolution. 

* teams are inherent distributed. No one should hold the pronoun 'remote', as this makes them a second-class citizen in the company culture. This leads to them be left out of discussions, decisions, and other parts of the business. 
* The most effective forms of influence 
  * rationale
  * inspirational appeals
  * consultation
  * collaboration


## Meetings

* Don't just talk about ideas.  Talk about specific actions, and who will act.
* Agree on both an action, and a target delivery date.  Or, groom the card for story-point estimation

### Accountability

* Avoid talking about an idea, and not confirming actions to be taken by specific people.
* Do not agree upon an action, while omitting a delivery date. (or even a touch-point for review)

### Multitasking

Multitasking emerges naturally with optimization, and growth of the company.  While it is not ideal, there are a few key mechanisms to understand, talk about, and have clear for all.

> ðŸ’¡ The tl;dr here is that if many people are not paying attention in a meeting, make the meeting more concise, change its membership, and consider canceling it in favor async status updates.

#### Note taking
Laptops and other devices are a natural part of taking notes, for many people.  The use for notes needs to be reinforced.  People still need to avoid 'banging' on keyboards, and disrupting the flow of presentation and conversation. 

#### Brief and Focused
Meetings can sometimes ramble, or exercise one person's ability to communicate comfortably. If the meeting will routinely involve this element of personal support, aim for a smaller audience that can reduce the pressure of public speaking, and also provide feedback intermittently.

#### Participation
#### Have a role; assignment
#### Agenda
