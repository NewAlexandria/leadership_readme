# Partners and Account Management

Interacting with partners involves a mix of 
1. capturing all critical data and 
1. making adjustments to our partnership(s) that make the most sense for them
1. not overcomplexifying thgeir scope of work in a way that harms the relationship 

## Phone conversations
Learning the best judgement skills, to apply (only) what is applicable to your conversation, can be an art.  

In all cases, it is encouraged
1. to have these conversations over the phone,
1. followed up by a recap email to the partner, and
1. logged into the CRM (e.g. Salesforce) thereafter.


## When negotiating a pricing change
_(i.e. increase in rev share, increase/decrease in pricing, offering of tiered model, bonus potential) please capture / cover / ask:_


* What do you expect in regards to performance as a result of this?  An estimate would be much appreciated so we can benchmark / set expectations for ourselves - even if it's a range.
* When can we expect to see performance effected by this change?
* Will this have a long term effect on your models and negatively impact anything? (if applicable)
* How long do you suggest we run this test to see statistical significance? (i.e. 4 weeks)
* Do you foresee seasonality or competition playing a part / influencing performance at all?
* Are there any technical updates during this test period occurring on your end that may alter performance / reporting?
* Would it be possible(daily, bi-weekly, etc.) reporting, inclusive of (key KPIs): i.e. leads, funded, clicks, CTR, etc.?
* Would you like to see any reporting from our side?
